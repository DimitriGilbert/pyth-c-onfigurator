pyth(c)onfigurator is a small soft wich allow you to install and configure other soft based on a XML description file

at the moment the project is only in french, cause it's easier for me while developping it, however if you want a traduction of it (or at least the kitchen :P) just ask me and i'll be pleased to provide it to you 

QUICK START :

Execute the script with root rights :
	sudo python pyth.c.onfigurator 
	
the script update your system first and when you get the following message :
	votre syst√®me est a jour
you're good to run internal command.
to load an XML file (e.g simple_lamp.xml, that i provide) run the following commands
	load /path/to/simple_lamp.xml
	run
	
Few commands are already accessible manually, copy a file for example :
	cp from="/path/to/the/file" to="/path/to/destination" type="file"
	
most of the work must be done over here ^^

new XML commands will be added as i need them for my work 

xml tree description :
report to soft.xml file

/!\ be careful, some strings are base64 encoded !! /!\

BUILDING XML SCRIPT

to build an xml file, you can use the provided kitchen (written in javascript an html), 
(it's still in french....^^) or create it by hand.

Enjoy !!
